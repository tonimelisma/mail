# Domain Layer and Use Case Implementation: Journey & Learnings

## 1. Initial Goal

The primary objective was to implement a robust domain layer for an Android email application. This
involved:

- Creating a new `:domain` Gradle module.
- Defining and implementing use cases for all core email functionalities based on `DESIGN.MD` and
  `UX.MD`.
- Interfacing with a data layer (`:core-data` and backend modules) through repository patterns.
- Refactoring ViewModels in the `:app` module to utilize these new use cases.
- Ensuring proper dependency injection using Hilt.

## 2. Current Project State: BUILD SUCCESSFUL!

After a significant effort in troubleshooting and refactoring, the command `./gradlew assembleDebug`
now **succeeds**. All library modules (`:core-data`, `:data`, `:domain`, `:backend-google`,
`:backend-microsoft`) and the main `:app` module are compiling correctly. Key architectural
misalignments and Hilt configuration issues have been resolved.

While the project builds, it's crucial to note:

* Some use cases in the `:domain` layer (`MoveMessageUseCase`, `MoveThreadUseCase`) are currently
  stubs.
* A specific block of code in `GmailApiHelper.moveMessage` related to `messageDetails?.labelIds` is
  temporarily commented out to resolve a persistent build error. This needs to be addressed to
  restore full functionality.
* Further testing is required to ensure runtime stability and correctness of all implemented
  features.

## 3. Phases of Implementation (Revised)

The implementation and stabilization progressed through several key phases:

1. **Initial Scaffolding (`:domain` module):**
    * Created directory structure for the `:domain` module.
    * Set up `domain/build.gradle.kts` (initially as `java-library`).
    * Included `:domain` in `settings.gradle.kts`.

2. **Use Case & Repository Interface Definition:**
    * Defined interfaces for primary use cases (`ObserveAuthStateUseCase`, `GetAccountsUseCase`,
      etc.) and action-oriented use cases (`DeleteMessageUseCase`, `MoveMessageUseCase`, etc.).
    * Defined corresponding methods in `AccountRepository`, `FolderRepository`, `MessageRepository`,
      and `ThreadRepository` interfaces in `:core-data`.

3. **Initial Build & `:core-data` "Purity" Misunderstanding:**
    * Encountered initial build issues. A key misunderstanding arose regarding the `:core-data`
      module's nature. It was initially assumed it needed to be a "pure Kotlin" module, leading to
      attempts to move Android-specific dependencies (like DataStore, Keystore) to the `:data`
      module.
    * **Correction:** Clarified that `:core-data` *can* be an Android library (
      `com.android.library`) and can contain Android dependencies. The primary goal for module
      separation was architectural, not strict platform independence for *all* core-data
      functionalities. This led to reverting changes that had moved
      `DefaultUserPreferencesRepository` and refactored `SecureEncryptionService`.

4. **`:domain` Module Configuration & Troubleshooting:**
    * **Module Type Change:** Converted `:domain` from `java-library` to `com.android.library`. This
      was crucial as the `:domain` layer needed to interact with repositories and models from
      `:core-data` which itself is an Android library. This involved adding an `android` block to
      its `build.gradle.kts` and a minimal `AndroidManifest.xml`.
    * **Hilt Setup Correction:** The Hilt setup in `domain/build.gradle.kts` was incorrect for an
      Android library. It was changed from `id("dagger.hilt.android.plugin")` and
      `kapt("com.google.dagger:hilt-compiler:...")` to `id("com.google.dagger.hilt.android")` and
      `ksp("com.google.dagger:hilt-compiler:...")`, aligning with standard Android Hilt practices
      and KSP.
    * **SDK & Hilt Version Alignment:** Ensured `compileSdk`, `minSdk`, and Hilt versions matched
      across relevant modules.
    * **Stubbing UseCases:** Created stub implementations for `MoveMessageUseCase.kt` and
      `MoveThreadUseCase.kt` to resolve KSP errors in the `:domain` module caused by missing
      classes.

5. **`MailApiService` Expansion & Backend Implementation (Microsoft & Google):**
    * Added new methods to `core-data/.../MailApiService.kt` for details, marking read, deletion,
      and moving.
    * Implemented these in `GraphApiHelper.kt` (Microsoft) and `GmailApiHelper.kt` (Google).
    * **Troubleshooting `:backend-google`:**
        * Added missing Ktor import `io.ktor.client.request.accept`.
        * Added explicit import for `kotlinx.serialization.json.add` to resolve `putJsonArray`
          issues.
        * Corrected `GmailApiHelper.markThreadRead` to use `message.isRead` (from `core-data`
          `Message` model) instead of a non-existent `message.labelIds`.
        * Temporarily commented out a block in `GmailApiHelper.moveMessage` (
          `messageDetails?.labelIds`) to resolve a persistent "Unresolved reference: labelIds"
          error, allowing the module to build.

6. **Repository Implementation & Refinement (`:data` module):**
    * Implemented `MailApiService` methods in `DefaultMessageRepository.kt` and
      `DefaultThreadRepository.kt`.
    * **Signature Mismatches:** Corrected numerous method signature mismatches between repository
      interfaces (in `:core-data`) and their implementations (in `:data`). This involved:
        * `MessageRepository.getMessageDetails`: Changed to `suspend` in the interface and
          implementation.
        * `DefaultMessageRepository.setTargetFolder`: Removed an extraneous `activityForRefresh`
          parameter.
        * `DefaultMessageRepository.moveMessage`: Corrected signature; added logic to use
          `currentTargetFolder?.id`.
        * `DefaultThreadRepository.moveThread`: Implemented the method with correct signature; added
          logic for `currentFolderId`.
    * **Kotlin Flow/Collection Operators:**
        * In `DefaultMessageRepository.getMessageDetails`, resolved
          `Unresolved reference 'firstOrNull'` by adding
          `import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.firstOrNull`.
        * Explicitly typed variables to aid Kotlin's type inference for `.find { ... }` operations.
    * **Model Property Access:** In `DefaultThreadRepository.markThreadRead`, corrected logic to
      update `unreadMessageCount` on `MailThread` instead of a non-existent `isRead` property.
    * **Dependency Resolution:** In `DefaultMessageRepository.getMessageDetails`, fixed
      `Unresolved reference 'getAccount'` by changing
      `accountRepository.getAccount(accountId).firstOrNull()` to correctly fetch from
      `accountRepository.getAccounts().firstOrNull()?.find { it.id == accountId }`.

7. **Use Case Adjustments (`:domain` module):**
    * `GetMessageDetailsUseCase.invoke` was made `suspend` due to the
      `MessageRepository.getMessageDetails` becoming `suspend`.

8. **Hilt Duplicate Binding Resolution (`:app` module):**
    * Resolved `[Dagger/DuplicateBindings]` error for `ThreadRepository`. The binding was correctly
      present in `:data:DataModule` and was redundantly also in `:app:RepositoryModule`. Removed the
      duplicate from the `:app` module.

9. **Final Build Success:** Achieved `./gradlew assembleDebug` success.

## 4. Deviations from Original Plan (Revised)

* **Build System & Module Inter-dependency Complexity:** The initial plan underestimated the
  friction of module types (`java-library` vs. `com.android.library`) and the precise Hilt
  configuration needed for the `:domain` module when it depends on Android libraries like
  `:core-data`.
* **Ktor DSL Issues (Earlier Phase):** A significant, unplanned detour (documented in previous
  iterations of this file, but largely resolved now) was related to Ktor DSL, which was eventually
  simplified by relying on `ContentNegotiation`.
* **Nature of `:core-data` and `:domain`:**
    * Initial intent for `:domain` might have been "pure Kotlin," but to effectively use
      repositories from `:core-data` (an Android library), `:domain` itself became an Android
      library.
    * The discussion about whether `:core-data` should be "pure Kotlin" vs. an Android library led
      to a course correction: it's acceptable for `:core-data` to have Android dependencies if they
      are core to its data handling (e.g., `DataStore`). The focus shifted to architectural
      separation rather than strict platform independence for *all* parts of `:core-data`.
* **`MailApiService.getMessageDetails` Signature (Unchanged from previous report):** Changed from
  `getMessageDetails(messageId: String, accountId: String)` to
  `getMessageDetails(messageId: String)`.
* **`currentFolderId` in Move UseCases (Unchanged from previous report, but now addressed in
  repository implementations):** While use cases might not pass `currentFolderId`, repository
  implementations (`DefaultMessageRepository`, `DefaultThreadRepository`) now attempt to use
  `currentTargetFolder?.id` for API calls that require it. This might need further review for
  robustness.

## 5. Mistakes Made (by AI during assistance)

* **Premature Refactoring for "Purity":** I initially hyper-focused on making `:core-data` a "pure
  Kotlin" module by attempting to move Android-specific classes like
  `DefaultUserPreferencesRepository` (using DataStore) and `SecureEncryptionService` (using Android
  Keystore) into the `:data` module. This was based on a misunderstanding of the user's actual
  constraint, which was more about the `:domain` layer's initial setup and overall project
  language (Kotlin vs. Java) rather than absolute platform-agnosticism for `:core-data`. This led to
  unnecessary file movements and refactoring that had to be reverted.
* **Incorrect Hilt Plugin for `:domain`:** For a period, I struggled with the correct Hilt Gradle
  plugin for the `:domain` module after it was converted to an Android library, initially suggesting
  older KAPT-based setups or slightly incorrect plugin IDs.
* **Overlooking Missing Imports:** In a few instances, compilation errors like "Unresolved
  reference: firstOrNull" or "Unresolved reference: update" were due to missing Kotlin Flow
  extension function imports, which I didn't spot immediately.
* **Incorrect Method Signature Fixes:** Sometimes, my suggested fixes for repository method
  signature mismatches were incomplete or didn't fully align with the interface or the build errors.
* **File Existence Assumption:** At one point, I attempted to edit a non-existent file (
  `DefaultUserPreferencesRepository.kt` in the `:data` module after incorrectly moving it),
  requiring a backtrack.

## 6. Surprises & Learnings (Revised)

* **Ktor `ContentNegotiation` is Key (Re-iterated):** Still a major learning.
* **Gradle Module Types & Hilt (Re-iterated & Expanded):** The interplay is complex. An Android
  library module (`:domain`) using Hilt needs `id("com.google.dagger.hilt.android")` and KSP, not
  the simpler `java-library` Hilt setup.
* **Hilt Duplicate Bindings:** Hilt is strict about single bindings. Duplicate providers for the
  same type (even if binding the same implementation) in different modules that get included in the
  same component (e.g., `SingletonComponent`) will cause build failures. Bindings should reside in
  the module "closest" to the implementation.
* **Kotlin Flow/Collection Operator Resolution:** Standard operators like `firstOrNull()` on a
  `Flow` or `find()` on a `List` require their specific imports (e.g.,
  `kotlinx.coroutines.flow.firstOrNull`) to be present. Errors like "Unresolved reference" for these
  can be confusing if the syntax looks correct. Explicitly typing intermediate variables can
  sometimes help the compiler and reveal underlying type issues.
* **API Idiosyncrasies (Unchanged from previous report).**
* **Error Handling & Re-authentication (Unchanged from previous report).**
* **Tooling (`edit_file`) (Unchanged from previous report).**
* **Iterative Debugging (Re-iterated):** The path to a successful build was highly iterative,
  involving many cycles of: try fix -> build -> analyze error -> refine fix. This was especially
  true for the Hilt, repository signature, and Kotlin Flow issues.

## 7. Code Smells & Shortcuts (Revised)

* **`GmailApiHelper.moveMessage` Temporary Comment:** The block of code involving
  `messageDetails?.labelIds` is currently commented out in `GmailApiHelper.moveMessage`. This was a
  workaround for a persistent "Unresolved reference: labelIds" build error. **This is a significant
  shortcut and needs to be fixed.**
* **`GraphApiHelper` Thread Operations (Unchanged).**
* **`GmailApiHelper` `moveMessage/moveThread` Label Logic (Unchanged).**
* **Stub Use Cases (`:domain`):** `MoveMessageUseCase` and `MoveThreadUseCase` are currently stubs
  returning `Result.success(Unit)`.
* **Error Handling Specificity (Unchanged).**
* **Date Parsing Robustness (Unchanged).**
* **`getMessageDetails` Body Handling (Graph & Gmail) (Unchanged).**
* **Hardcoded Folder References in Stubs (Unchanged).**
* **`selectFields` Parameter in Gmail Helpers (Unchanged).**
* **Ktor Client Configuration Repetition (Unchanged).**
* **`currentFolderId` in Repository Move Operations:** `DefaultMessageRepository.moveMessage` and
  `DefaultThreadRepository.moveThread` use `currentTargetFolder?.id` when the `MailApiService`
  requires a `currentFolderId`. This is a fallback and might not be robust for all UI scenarios (
  e.g., moving an item not in the currently displayed folder). The repository interfaces for these
  move operations might need to be revisited to explicitly accept `currentFolderId`.

## 8. Outstanding Work for Use Case Operation & Build Stability (Revised & Prioritized)

The immediate next steps should focus on making the existing, stubbed use cases operational and
ensuring the build is stable with all necessary logic included.

1. **Fix `GmailApiHelper.moveMessage` `labelIds` Issue (High Priority):**
    * Investigate the "Unresolved reference: labelIds" error that necessitated commenting out the
      `messageDetails?.labelIds` block.
    * Possible causes: incorrect import for `GmailMessage`, an issue with Kotlinx Serialization KSP
      not generating metadata correctly for that specific field, a subtle type inference problem, or
      a classpath conflict.
    * Uncomment the block and work to resolve the compilation error. This is critical for correct
      Gmail message moving functionality.

2. **Implement Stubbed Use Cases (High Priority):**
    * **`MoveMessageUseCase.kt`:** Uncomment the call to `messageRepository.moveMessage(...)` and
      ensure it functions correctly with the repository's current implementation (which uses
      `currentTargetFolder?.id`).
    * **`MoveThreadUseCase.kt`:** Uncomment the call to `threadRepository.moveThread(...)` and
      ensure it functions correctly.

3. **Verify `currentFolderId` Logic in Repositories:**
    * Review the use of `currentTargetFolder?.id` in `DefaultMessageRepository.moveMessage` and
      `DefaultThreadRepository.moveThread`.
    * Determine if the `MessageRepository` and `ThreadRepository` interfaces for `moveMessage` and
      `moveThread` should be updated to include `currentFolderId` as a parameter, making it
      explicit. This would then flow up to the UseCases.

4. **Comprehensive Testing (Post-Stub Implementation):**
    * **Unit Tests:**
        * Write/complete unit tests for all use cases in `:domain`, mocking repository dependencies.
        * Write/complete unit tests for `DefaultMessageRepository` and `DefaultThreadRepository`,
          mocking `MailApiService` and `AccountService` dependencies.
        * Write/complete unit tests for `GraphApiHelper` and `GmailApiHelper` (focus on the
          new/modified methods).
    * **Manual Runtime Testing:** Thoroughly test all functionalities that were recently fixed or
      un-stubbed:
        * Viewing message lists and details.
        * Marking messages/threads as read/unread.
        * Deleting messages/threads.
        * **Moving messages/threads (especially for Gmail once the `labelIds` issue is fixed).**

5. **Full & Optimized `MailApiService` Implementations (Medium Priority):**
    * **`GraphApiHelper.kt`:** Re-implement `markThreadRead`, `deleteThread`, and `moveThread` using
      efficient batch operations if available.
    * Address other `TODOs` and efficiency concerns as previously listed.

6. **Use Case Review & Expansion (Medium Priority):**
    * Review existing use cases against `UX.MD`.
    * Identify and plan implementation for missing core use cases (Compose, Reply, etc.).

7. **Dependency Injection (Hilt) Final Review (Low Priority unless new issues arise).**
8. **Documentation Updates (Ongoing).**
9. **Performance Profiling & Optimization (Post-Major Functionality).**
10. **Final UX Alignment (Post-Major Functionality).**

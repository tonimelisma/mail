# Changelog: Refactoring MicrosoftTokenPersistenceService into MicrosoftAuthManager

**Date:** May 17, 2025

## Objective

To remove the `MicrosoftTokenPersistenceService` class as a direct Hilt/KSP resolution problem-point
by merging its responsibilities into `MicrosoftAuthManager`. This aims to preserve all existing
functionality, especially the integration of Microsoft accounts with Android's `AccountManager`,
including secure token storage and account data management.

## Summary of Changes

The core of this refactoring involved transferring all logic and responsibilities from
`MicrosoftTokenPersistenceService` into `MicrosoftAuthManager`.

### 1. `MicrosoftAuthManager.kt` (
`backend-microsoft/src/main/java/net/melisma/backend_microsoft/auth/MicrosoftAuthManager.kt`)

* **New Dependencies Added:**
    * `@ApplicationContext private val context: Context`: Ensured application context is used for
      `AccountManager`.
    * `private val secureEncryptionService: SecureEncryptionService`: For encrypting/decrypting
      tokens.
    * `@Dispatcher(MailDispatchers.IO) private val ioDispatcher: CoroutineDispatcher`: For running
      persistence operations on a background thread.
* **Moved Constants and Data Class:**
    * Private constants related to `AccountManager` keys (`ACCOUNT_TYPE_MICROSOFT`,
      `KEY_ACCESS_TOKEN`, etc.) were moved from `MicrosoftTokenPersistenceService`.
    * The `PersistedMicrosoftAccount` data class was moved into `MicrosoftAuthManager.kt` (as a
      file-level data class).
* **Implemented AccountManager Interaction Logic:**
    * Initialized `AccountManager` instance.
    * Private suspend functions
      `saveAccountInfoToAccountManager(authResult: IAuthenticationResult): Boolean` and
      `deleteAccountFromAccountManager(accountManagerName: String): Boolean` were created by porting
      the exact logic from `MicrosoftTokenPersistenceService`. These handle:
        * Adding accounts to `AccountManager` via `addAccountExplicitly`.
        * Storing encrypted access and ID tokens using `SecureEncryptionService`.
        * Storing other non-sensitive account details (`msalAccountId`, `username`, `tenantId`,
          `displayName`, etc.).
        * Removing accounts from `AccountManager` via `removeAccountExplicitly`.
        * Error handling and basic rollback for save operations.
* **Integration into MSAL Callbacks:**
    * In `signInInteractive`: On successful authentication (`AuthenticationCallback.onSuccess`),
      `saveAccountInfoToAccountManager` is now called to persist the account details.
    * In `signOut`: On successful account removal from MSAL (
      `IMultipleAccountPublicClientApplication.RemoveAccountCallback.onRemoved`),
      `deleteAccountFromAccountManager` is called to remove the account from Android's
      `AccountManager`.
* **New Public Methods for Account Data Access:**
    * The following public suspend functions were added, porting their logic from
      `MicrosoftTokenPersistenceService`, to allow querying persisted data:
        * `getPersistedAccountData(accountManagerName: String): PersistedMicrosoftAccount?`
        * `getAccessTokenFromAccountManager(accountManagerName: String): String?`
        * `getAllPersistedMicrosoftAccounts(): List<PersistedMicrosoftAccount>`

### 2. `MicrosoftAccountRepository.kt` (
`backend-microsoft/src/main/java/net/melisma/backend_microsoft/repository/MicrosoftAccountRepository.kt`)

* **Removed `MicrosoftTokenPersistenceService` Dependency:** The injected instance of
  `MicrosoftTokenPersistenceService` was removed from the constructor.
* **Removed Direct Persistence Call:** The explicit call to
  `microsoftTokenPersistenceService.deleteAccount()` in the `signOut` method was removed, as this
  logic is now encapsulated within `MicrosoftAuthManager.signOut()`.

### 3. Deleted Files

The following files were deleted as their functionality is now merged into `MicrosoftAuthManager` or
they are no longer needed:

*
`backend-microsoft/src/main/java/net/melisma/backend_microsoft/auth/MicrosoftTokenPersistenceService.kt`
*
`backend-microsoft/src/main/java/net/melisma/backend_microsoft/auth/IMicrosoftTokenPersistenceService.kt`
* `backend-microsoft/src/main/java/net/melisma/backend_microsoft/di/AuthPersistenceModule.kt`

## Rationale for Changes

* **Resolve Hilt/KSP Issue:** The primary driver was to eliminate `MicrosoftTokenPersistenceService`
  as a separate Hilt-injected component that was causing KSP resolution problems.
* **Co-location of Concerns:** Merging the logic into `MicrosoftAuthManager` co-locates MSAL API
  operations with their direct Android `AccountManager` side effects, making `MicrosoftAuthManager`
  the single source of truth for Microsoft account state both within the app (MSAL) and on the
  system (`AccountManager`).
* **Preserve and Correct Functionality:** The changes ensure that all previously intended
  `AccountManager` integration features are preserved. Critically, it also *corrects* an omission
  where account information was not being saved to `AccountManager` upon sign-in, despite being part
  of the original design.

## Surprising Discoveries

* **`saveAccountInfo` Not Utilized:** The most significant finding during the analysis phase was
  that the `MicrosoftTokenPersistenceService.saveAccountInfo()` method, responsible for adding
  accounts to `AccountManager`, was **not being called anywhere in the Kotlin codebase**, despite
  its presence and documentation in `DESIGN.md`. The refactoring has now correctly integrated this
  crucial step into the `signInInteractive` flow within `MicrosoftAuthManager`. This means the
  application previously only deleted accounts from `AccountManager` during sign-out but never
  added/updated them upon sign-in.

## Soft Spots & Open Questions

* **Error Handling in Persistence:** While the ported `saveAccountInfoToAccountManager` includes a
  rollback mechanism for the `addAccountExplicitly` step, comprehensive error handling for
  subsequent `setUserData` calls (e.g., if encryption fails for one token but not another) could be
  further reviewed. The current behavior mimics the original class.
* **`acquireTokenSilent` and New Account Persistence:** Account persistence to `AccountManager` has
  been added to `signInInteractive`. MSAL's `acquireTokenSilent` typically operates on known
  accounts. If an edge case exists where `acquireTokenSilent` could effectively "discover" or fully
  authenticate a new account not yet known to `AccountManager`, it wouldn't be persisted by the
  current changes. This is considered low risk.
* **Concurrency of Persistence Operations:** The `AccountManager` operations within
  `signInInteractive` and `signOut` are launched in `externalScope` (using `ioDispatcher`
  internally). This makes them asynchronous side effects. This is generally acceptable, but if
  stricter guarantees about the completion of these operations before the main
  authentication/sign-out flow proceeds were required, the implementation would need adjustment.
* **Testing:** The `MicrosoftAuthManager` now has significantly expanded responsibilities. Thorough
  unit tests with mocks for `AccountManager` and `SecureEncryptionService` are crucial to validate
  the new persistence logic, including correct key usage, encryption, decryption, and data handling.
* **`PersistedMicrosoftAccount` Data Class Visibility:** This data class is now defined as a
  file-level (package-private visibility by default) class within `MicrosoftAuthManager.kt`. Since
  it's part of the public API of `MicrosoftAuthManager` (return type for methods like
  `getAllPersistedMicrosoftAccounts`), this visibility is acceptable. If it were needed more broadly
  or outside the package, making it a public top-level class would be an alternative.

This refactoring successfully consolidates the Microsoft authentication and `AccountManager`
persistence logic, addresses the Hilt/KSP issue, and crucially, implements the previously missing
account saving functionality.
